<p>A project through the Developmental Science Lab at Temple University
is currently studying how infants learn to reach and grasp for a pencil
from 6 to 14-months. We use a customized software (TrHandy, Ab.Acus) to
code videos submitted by parents and can extract the kinematic
properties of the reach and grasp. Of particular interest is the
emergence of the mature pincer grasp. At 14-months, infants come to the
lab and participate in a tactile oddball paradigm stimulating their
fingertips while undergoing EEG. Of particular interest is a neural
signature (somatosensory mismatch negativity - sMMN) in the
frontocentral regions. We hypothesize that functional differences in the
way infants use their pinky and middle fingers to grasp will relate to
neural body representations, manifesting as greater sMMN in response to
a tactile stimulation of the middle finger versus the pinky finger.</p>

<h4><em>Cognition-action tradeoffs and the organization of
attention</em></h4>
<p>This chapter discusses what cognition–action trade-offs in infancy
reveal about the organization and developmental trajectory of attention.
We focus on internal attention because this aspect is most relevant to
the immediate concerns of infancy, such as fluctuating levels of
expertise, balancing multiple taxing skills simultaneously, learning how
to control attention under variable conditions, and coordinating
distinct psychological domains. Cognition–action trade-offs observed
across the life span include perseveration during skill emergence,
errors and inefficient strategies during decision making, and the
allocation of resources when attention is taxed. An embodied
cognitive-load account interprets these behavioral patterns as a result
of limited attentional resources allocated across simultaneous, taxing
task demands. For populations where motor errors could be costly, like
infants and the elderly, attention is typically devoted to motor demands
with errors occurring in the cognitive domain. In contrast, healthy
young adults tend to preserve their cognitive performance by modifying
their actions.</p>

<h4><em>Motor development in context</em></h4>
<p>The study of motor development has traditionally focused on the
timing and sequence of the acquisition of motor skills, such as sitting,
crawling, or walking, over the first years of life. Because motor skills
are directly observable, motor development serves as a useful exemplar
for general principles of development. Current frameworks emphasize
motor development in and as a context, such as how change in motor skill
interacts with simultaneous change in other developmental domains, how
the acquisition of new motor skills creates new opportunities for
learning, and how the context in which motor development occurs shapes
the course of development. For example, the onset of new motor skills
changes the allocation of attentional resources, the quality of infants’
sleep, and available perceptual information. Reciprocally, contexts such
as culturally specific parenting practices and individual differences in
everyday experiences impact the timing and trajectory of new motor
skills.</p>

<h4><em>The impact of motor experience on exploration and problem
solving</em></h4>
<p>One hundred and six infants with varied independent walking
experience faced the problem of navigating a tunnel to reach a
caregiver. Solving the task required infants to switch from standing to
crawling so they could fit their bodies into the tunnel. Spontaneous
exploratory behaviors were documented. Infants who did not immediately
go through the tunnel received a strict 15-step training protocol to
highlight relevant details of the task. Age and walk experience were
entered as predictors into a series of stepwise regressions on measures
of exploratory and problem-solving behaviors. In general, older infants
were more successful than younger infants in completing the task. A
significant nonlinear relationship was documented between walk
experience and some outcome measures. Infants with a moderate amount of
walk experience had more difficulty than those with very little or a
lot. Microgenetically documenting problem solving as a function of
experience revealed that attention is taxed during mastery of a motor
skill. Availability of attentional resources, in turn, impacted</p>

class="section level4">
<h4><em>Newly walking infants’ night sleep impacts next day learning and
problem solving</em></h4>
<p>Sleep is part of the process that prepares children and adults for
next day cognitive activity. Insufficient or fragmented sleep has a
detrimental impact on subsequent encoding (Rouleau et al., 2002) and
cognitive functioning (Joo et al., 2012). However, fragmented sleep
early in life is a developmental norm, limiting the extent to which
conclusions derived from older populations can be generalized. To
directly test the continuity of this relationship, newly-walking
infants’ (N = 58) sleep was monitored overnight using actigraphy. The
next morning they were taught a motor problem-solving task. The task
required infants to navigate through a tunnel to reach a goal at the
other end. We coded infants’ exploratory behaviors and the extent of
training required to solve the task. Using a cluster analysis that
accounted for exploratory behaviors and number of training prompts,
infants were sorted into three profiles: those who found the task Easy
to solve, those who found it Difficult, and those who Never solved it.
Wake episodes and sleep efficiency were entered as predictors of cluster
membership in a multinomial logistic regression. Of the infants who
ultimately solved the task, those with more wake episodes and lower
sleep efficiency had more difficulty. Specifically, fragmentation
appeared to negatively impact preparedness to learn. Contrary to our
expectations, infants who Never solved the task had the least fragmented
sleep, indicating that an optimal level of fragmentation is needed for
efficient problem-solving. For infants, some level of sleep
fragmentation is needed the night before learning in order to solve a
task efficiently. These findings highlight the interaction between
developmental domains, from sleep quality to motor experience, and their
impact on infant learning in real time.</p>

class="section level4">
<h4><em>Nap timing makes a difference: Sleeping sooner rather than later
after learning improves infants’ locomotor problem solving</em></h4>
<p>Twenty-nine newly-walking infants who had recently given up crawling
trained to navigate a shoulder-height, nylon tunnel to reach a caregiver
waiting at the other end. Infants in the Nap First group napped within
30 min of initial training. Infants in the Delay First group napped four
hours after training. All infants were retested six hours after training
on the same locomotor problem. Learning was measured by the number of
training prompts required to solve the task, exploration, and time to
solve the problem. Nap First infants benefited the most from a nap; they
required fewer training prompts, used fewer posture shifts from training
to test, and solved the task faster compared to Delay First infants,
suggesting that optimally timed sleep does not merely protect against
interference, but actively contributes to memory consolidation. This
study highlights the importance of nap timing as a design feature and
was a first step towards limit-testing the boundaries of the relation
between sleep and learning. Infants’ fragile memories require regular
consolidation with intermittent periods of sleep to prevent interference
or forgetting.</p>

<h4><em>The unique contributions of day and night sleep to infant motor
problem solving</em></h4>
<p>The current study sought to tease apart the unique contributions of
napping and nighttime sleep to infant learning, specifically in the
context of motor problem solving. We challenged 54 walking infants to
solve a novel locomotor problem at three time points— training, test,
and follow-up the next morning. One group of infants napped during the
delay between training and test. Another group did not sleep during the
delay. A third group received the test immediately after training with
no delay. Only the Nap group’s strategy choices continued to improve
through the follow-up session, suggesting that daytime sleep has an
active role in strengthening otherwise fragile memory. Although group
did not affect strategy maintenance, walk experience did, suggesting
that task difficulty may shape the impact of sleep on learning. Thus,
day sleep and night sleep make independent contributions to the
consolidation of motor problem-solving strategies during infancy.</p>

<h4><em>Longitudinal assessment of sleep and motor milestone

statistics including number of wake episodes, sleep efficiency, total
sleep time, and sleep onset latency. We looked for patterns in the
nights immediately before and after the acquisition of sitting, pulling
to stand, hands-and-knees crawling, cruising, and walking.</p>

<h4><em>Comparing researcher choices for sleep assessment</em></h4>
<p>Incorporating infant sleep, either as a predictor or as an outcome
variable, into interdisciplinary work has become increasingly popular.
Sleep researchers face many methodological choices that have
implications for the reliability and validity of the data. Here, the
authors directly investigated the impact of design and measurement
choices in a small, longitudinal sample of infants. Three sleep
measurement techniques—parent-reported sleep diaries, actigraphy
(Micromini Sleep Watch), and a commercial videosomnography (Nanit)—were
included, using actigraphy as the baseline. Nine infants’ sleep (4
girls) was measured longitudinally using all three measurement
techniques. Nanit provided summary statistics, using a proprietary
algorithm, for nightly sleep parameters. The actigraphy data were
analyzed with both the Sadeh Infant and Sadeh algorithms. The extent to
which measurements converged on sleep start and end time, number of wake
episodes, sleep efficiency, and sleep duration was assessed. Measures
were positively correlated. Difference scores revealed similar patterns
of greater sleep estimation in parent reports and Nanit compared with
actigraphy. Bland- Altman plots revealed that much of the data were
within the limits of agreement, tentatively suggesting that Nanit and
actigraphy may be used interchangeably. Graphs display significant
variability within and between individual infants as well as across
measurement techniques. Potential confounding variables that may explain
the discrepancies between parent report, Sadeh Infant, Sadeh, and Nanit
are discussed. The findings are also used to speak to the advantages and
disadvantages of design and measurement choices. Future directions focus
on the unique contributions of each measurement technique and how to
capitalize on them.</p>

<h4><em>New in-home methods for studying sleep states in
infancy</em></h4>
<p>Research studying the role of sleep in development abounds but
focuses on global aspects of sleep like quality or timing. Far fewer
studies include the ultradian cycle, or patterns of REM and non- REM
(NREM), because doing so is costly in time and resources. In a complete,
lab-based sleep study, individuals are monitored by a technician
overnight while wearing a host of sensors to capture brain activity, eye
and limb movement, and cardiorespiratory rates. There is a need for
creative, minimally disruptive solutions to study sleep that do not
compromise the richness and accuracy of the measurements. The current
pilot study parsed down the physiological measures to only movement and
cardiorespiratory rates, creating a protocol simple enough for
caregivers to incorporate into bedtime. Ten 12-month-old infants (+/- 3
weeks) wore an actigraph and wireless cardiorespiratory sensor for five
nights of data collection. Of this, 92% were useable data. Actigraphy
was analyzed with the Sadeh algorithm to delineate sleep from wake.
Heart rate and respiration were then used to state score visually or via
an algorithm; greater variability demarcated REM from NREM. Time spent
in each state was compared between scoring methods as well as to
published results from age matched infants who underwent polysomnography
(PSG). Visually scored data, using a 1-hour viewing window, was in line
with peer’s PSG values. To automatically state score, epoch-by-epoch
cardiorespiratory and actigraphy files were produced for each minute of
data collection. Heart and respiratory rates were transformed into
z-scores and iterations of scoring, using increasingly greater z score
thresholds, were compared to determine which identified state
proportions most similar to data collected with PSG. Based on these
results, our novel method appears to be a feasible choice for studying
the ultradian cycle. The combination of actigraphy and cardiorespiratory
monitoring is uniquely advantageous because it is less resource
intensive and more naturalistic, being put on by caregivers while still
resulting in high rates of good data. Taken together, it is a quality
option for infant researchers interested in incorporating sleep into
their paradigms.</p>
